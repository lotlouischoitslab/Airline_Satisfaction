# Motivation 
Air travel is a crucial type of mobility amongst people who are traveling from one place to another. Air transportation also enables economic growth and development for countries. I was very lucky to use Incheon International Airport to travel around the world because ICN is one of the best airports in the world. Due to severe congestions on roadways, I have also been recently very interested about air transportation and how we could make ways to improve the quality and service of air mobility. As an aviation enthusiast myself, I was also curious about the satisfaction of our airline and airport service. To achieve my goal, I decided to get some air travel datasets and perform experimental data analysis and prediction to analyze and predict the passengers' satisfaction trends of air travel service.
